## Added repo + twitter link

Added a link to the GitHub repo and twitter account in the upper right of the header.

### Fixed markdown styling

Fixed the markdown elements having no styling due to the tailwind css reset.

### Initial commit

Initial `CHANGELOG.md` commit. For now we're not starting versioning yet, because that would be a bit trivial.
